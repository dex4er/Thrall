NAME
    Thrall - a simple PSGI/Plack HTTP server which uses threads

SYNOPSIS
      $ plackup -s Thrall --port=80 [options] your-app.psgi

      $ plackup -s Thrall --port=443 --ssl=1 --ssl-key-file=file.key --ssl-cert-file=file.crt [options] your-app.psgi

      $ plackup -s Thrall --port=80 --ipv6 [options] your-app.psgi

      $ plackup -s Thrall --socket=/tmp/thrall.sock [options] your-app.psgi

DESCRIPTION
    Thrall is a standalone HTTP/1.1 server with keep-alive support. It uses
    threads instead pre-forking, so it works correctly on Windows. It is
    pure-Perl implementation which doesn't require any XS package.

NOTES
    Thrall was started as a fork of Starlet server. It has almost the same
    code as Starlet and it was adapted to use threads instead fork().

SEE ALSO
    Starlet, Starman

LIMITATIONS
    See threads and perlthrtut to read about limitations for PSGI
    applications started with Thrall and check if you encountered a known
    problem.

    Especially, PSGI applications should avoid: changing current working
    directory, catching signals, starting new processes. Environment
    variables might (Linux, Unix) or might not (Windows) be shared between
    threads.

BUGS
    There is a problem with Perl threads implementation which occurs on
    Windows. Some requests can fail with message:

      failed to set socket to nonblocking mode:An operation was attempted on
      something that is not a socket.

    Cygwin version seems to be correct.

    This problem was introduced in Perl 5.16 and fixed in Perl 5.18.2 and
    Perl 5.19.5.
