NAME
    Thrall - a simple PSGI/Plack HTTP server which uses threads

SYNOPSIS
      $ plackup -s Thrall --port=80 [options] your-app.psgi

DESCRIPTION
    Thrall is a standalone HTTP/1.0 server with keep-alive support. It uses
    threads instead pre-forking, so it works correctly on Windows.

NOTES
    Thrall was started as a fork of Starlet server. It has almost the same
    code as Starlet and it was adapted to use threads instead fork().

SEE ALSO
    Starlet, Starman

BUGS
    There is a problem with Perl implementation on Windows XP/Vista/7. Some
    requests can fail with message:

      failed to set socket to nonblocking mode:An operation was attempted on
      something that is not a socket.

    Perl on Windows 8 works correctly.

    If you find the bug or want to implement new features, please report it
    at https://github.com/dex4er/Thrall/issues

    The code repository is available at http://github.com/dex4er/Thrall
