## NAME

thrall - a simple PSGI/Plack HTTP server that uses threads

## SYNOPSIS

```console

    $ thrall --max-workers=20 --max-reqs-per-child=100 app.psgi

    $ thrall --port=80 --ipv6=1 app.psgi

    $ thrall --port=443 --ssl=1 --ssl-key-file=file.key --ssl-cert-file=file.crt app.psgi

    $ thrall --socket=/tmp/thrall.sock app.psgi

```

## DESCRIPTION

Thrall is a standalone HTTP/1.1 server with keep-alive support. It uses
threads instead pre-forking, so it works correctly on Windows. It is a
pure-Perl implementation that doesn't require any XS package.

Thrall was started as a fork of [Starlet](https://metacpan.org/pod/Starlet) server. It has almost the same code
as [Starlet](https://metacpan.org/pod/Starlet) and it was adapted to use threads instead fork().

## OPTIONS

In addition to the options supported by [plackup](https://metacpan.org/pod/plackup), thrall accepts
following options(s).

## --access-log

Specifies the pathname of a file where the access log should be
written. By default, in the development environment access logs will
go to STDERR. See [plackup](https://metacpan.org/pod/plackup). (default: none)

## --daemonize

Makes the process run in the background. It doesn't work (yet) in native
Windows (MSWin32). (default: 0)

## -E, --env

Specifies the environment option. See [plackup](https://metacpan.org/pod/plackup). (default: "deployment")

## --error-log

Specify the pathname of a file where the error log should be written. This
enables you to still have access to the errors when using `--daemonize`.
(default: none)

## --group

Changes the group ids or group names that the server should switch to after
binding to the port. The ids or names can be separated with commas or space
characters. (default: none)

## -I

Specifies Perl library include paths, like perl's `-I` option. You
may add multiple paths by using this option multiple times. See [plackup](https://metacpan.org/pod/plackup).

## --ipv6

Enables IPv6 support. The [IO::Socket::IP](https://metacpan.org/pod/IO%3A%3ASocket%3A%3AIP) module is required. (default: 0)

## --keepalive-timeout

Timeout for persistent connections. (default: 2)

## -L, --loader

Starlet changes the default loader to _Delayed_ to make lower consumption
of the children and prevent problems with shared IO handlers. It might be set to
`Plack::Loader` to restore the default loader.

## -M

Loads the named modules before loading the app's code. You may load
multiple modules by using this option multiple times. See [plackup](https://metacpan.org/pod/plackup).
(default: none)

## --main-process-delay

The Thrall does not synchronize its processes and it requires a small delay
in main process so it doesn't consume all CPU. (default: 0.1)

## --max-keepalive-reqs

Max. number of requests allowed per single persistent connection. If set to
one, persistent connections are disabled. (default: 1)

## --max-reqs-per-child

Max. number of requests to be handled before a worker process exits. (default:
1000)

## --max-workers

A number of worker threads. (default: 10)

## --min-reqs-per-child

If set, randomizes the number of requests handled by a single worker process
between the value and that supplied by `--max-reqs-per-chlid`.
(default: none)

## --pid

Specify the pid file path. Use it with `-D|--daemonize` option.
(default: none)

## -q, --quiet

Suppress the message about starting a server.

## -r, --reload

Makes plackup restart the server whenever a file in your development
directory changes. See [plackup](https://metacpan.org/pod/plackup). (default: none)

## -R, --Reload

Makes plackup restart the server whenever a file in any of the given
directories changes. See [plackup](https://metacpan.org/pod/plackup). (default: none)

## --socket

Enables UNIX socket support. The [IO::Socket::UNIX](https://metacpan.org/pod/IO%3A%3ASocket%3A%3AUNIX) module is required. The
socket file has to be not yet created. The first character `@` or `\0` in
the socket file name means that an abstract socket address will be created.
(default: none)

## --spawn-interval

If set, worker processes will not be spawned more than once every given
second. Also, when _SIGHUP_ is being received, no more than one worker
process will be collected every given second. This feature is useful for
doing a "slow restart". (default: none)

## --ssl

Enables SSL support. The [IO::Socket::SSL](https://metacpan.org/pod/IO%3A%3ASocket%3A%3ASSL) module is required. (default: 0)

## --ssl-ca-file

Specifies the path to the SSL CA certificate file which will be a part of
server's certificate chain. (default: none)

## --ssl-cert-file

Specifies the path to the SSL certificate file. (default: none)

## --ssl-client-ca-file

Specifies the path to the SSL CA certificate file for client verification.
(default: none)

## --ssl-key-file

Specifies the path to the SSL key file. (default: none)

## --ssl-verify-mode

Specifies the verification mode for the client certificate.
See ["SSL\_verify\_mode" in IO::Socket::SSL](https://metacpan.org/pod/IO%3A%3ASocket%3A%3ASSL#SSL_verify_mode) for details. (default: 0)

## --timeout

Seconds until timeout. (default: 300)

## --umask

Changes file mode creation mask. The ["umask" in perlfunc](https://metacpan.org/pod/perlfunc#umask) is an octal number
representing disabled permissions bits for newly created files. It is usually
`022` when a group shouldn't have permission to write or `002` when a group
should have permission to write. (default: none)

## --user

Changes the user id or user name that the server process should switch to
after binding to the port. The pid file, error log or unix socket also are
created before changing privileges. This option is usually used if the main
process is started with root privileges because binding to the low-numbered
(<1024) port. (default: none)

## LIMITATIONS

See ["BUGS AND LIMITATIONS" in threads](https://metacpan.org/pod/threads#BUGS-AND-LIMITATIONS) and ["Thread-Safety of
System Libraries" in perlthrtut](https://metacpan.org/pod/perlthrtut#Thread-Safety-of-System-Libraries) to read about limitations for PSGI applications started
with Thrall and check if you encountered a known problem.

Especially, PSGI applications should avoid: changing the current working
directory, catching signals, and starting new processes. Environment
variables might (Linux, Unix) or might not (Windows) be shared between
threads.

Thrall is very slow on the first request for each thread. It is because spawning
new threads is slow in Perl itself. Thrall is very fast on another request and
generally is faster than any implementation which uses fork.

## BUGS

There is a problem with Perl threads implementation which occurs on Windows.
Some requests can fail with the message:

> failed to set socket to nonblocking mode:An operation was attempted on
> something that is not a socket.

or

> Bad file descriptor at (eval 24) line 4.

Cygwin version seems to be correct.

This problem was introduced in Perl 5.16 and fixed in Perl 5.19.5.

See [https://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=119003](https://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=119003) and
[https://github.com/dex4er/Thrall/issues/5](https://github.com/dex4er/Thrall/issues/5) for more information about this
issue.

## MacOS

MacOS High Sierra and newer shows error:

> objc\[12345\]: +\[\_\_NSCFConstantString initialize\] may have been in progress in another thread when fork() was called.
> objc\[12345\]: +\[\_\_NSCFConstantString initialize\] may have been in progress in another thread when fork() was called. We cannot safely call it or ignore it in the fork() child process. Crashing instead. Set a breakpoint on objc\_initializeAfterForkError to debug.

This error is caused by an added security to restrict multithreading.

To override the limitation, run
`export OBJC_DISABLE_INITIALIZE_FORK_SAFETY=YES` before using this server.
